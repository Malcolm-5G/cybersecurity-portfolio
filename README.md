Prior IT Experience 
  I have an Assocciates in Information Technology. Even though I have this associates, I still lack the experience to succeed in the tech field. I love how IT is the backbone of an organization's network infrastructure. By protecting the companies persaonal data, protecting a company from various cyberattacks, to simply providing help desk assistance.  IT is essential for a company to function on a day to day basis. 

Career Plans
  After completing the cybersecurity course, my goal is start my jounery into the tech field through an entry level postion. For a year, I'll like to establish a role as a Security Analyst or Junior Network Administrator. Next, I would like to place more focus on becoming a Penetration Tester. I love how pen testers implement differnt attacks while provding solutions to protect organiziton's data. My dream job in this field is to one day start my own cybersecurity consulting firm.

Proud Project/Task
  One experience I’m proud about was during my college journey. My colleagues and I was giving the opportunity to present our project to our schools Town-hall meeting. This presentation, was about E-Sports and its future by being considered as a college sport. E-Sports was gaining traction as being established as a college sport at various schools throughout the country. This presentation led to our program hosting its First E-Sports event a year later. Also, our sister school actually established an E-Sports team where scholarships are provided just to play video games. This experience simply showed how an idea can turn into an opportunity for others.
